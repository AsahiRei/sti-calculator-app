  </h1>
  <p class="text-center text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg mt-2 text-gray-500">
    A simple tool that helps students compute their overall subject grade based
    on the four major grading periods: Prelims, Midterms, Prefinals, and Finals.
    Students enter their grade for each term, and the calculator automatically
    computes the final average and shows whether they passed or failed.
